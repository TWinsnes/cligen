Cligen includes two templates:

- basic
- interactive

## Basic

The basic template is a simple command line application with minimal dependencies and no configuration. It's intended for small applications with minimal use input, where a few command line flags is all that's needed.

## Interactive

The interactive template is a more complex command line application with a few dependencies and configuration. It's intended for larger applications with more use input, where a few command line flags is not enough. It renders an interactive prompt to ask for user input, with a lot of configuration options.
