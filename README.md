Cligen is a command line tool to generate go cli applications with a set of sane defaults, including ci/cd and release management. It takes a fair bit of time setting up the basics when building a new cli application, and this tool aims to make that process easier.

## Why did I make this?
I found myself writing quite a few cli tools, and it was always the same boilerplate over and over again, so I decided to create a tool to generate it for me. I could use an LLM to generate a lot of the structure, but I also wanted to make sure I had an opinionated and tested scaffold around building and releasing the app. So I've put together a tool that does it all for me. 

This way I have a well-structured base to build on, and I can focus on building the actual app.

I hope that you find it useful!

## Installation

Simplest way to install is by using homebrew

```shell
brew install twinsnes/tap/cligen
```

This makes cliegen available on our path and works around the MacOS Notarization requirement.
