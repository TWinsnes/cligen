A CLI tool to generate a CLI app scaffold with sane defaults and complete github CI/CD so you can focus on building the app rather than the boilerplate.

![Demo](demo.gif)

## Why did I make this?
I found myself writing quite a few cli tools, and it was always the same boilerplate over and over again, so I decided to create a tool to generate it for me. I could use an LLM to generate a lot of the golang code, but I also wanted to make sure I had an opinionated and tested scaffold around building and releasing the app. So I've put together a tool that does it all for me.

With this I can skip all the repetitive stuff and get straight into building the app.

I hope that you find it useful!
